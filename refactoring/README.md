# Refactoring

Refactoring is very important in relation to these topics. Just as important as the other topics covered here, is how to take good code and turn it into great code.

We can use [design patterns](patterns/README.md) to DRY up code and generalize abstractions. We must avoid [anti-patterns](anti_patterns/README.md) while we do this. While they may be tempting to employ, their costs outweigh their benefits.

> Shortcuts make for long days.

We can also use [idioms](idioms/README.md) to structure our code in a way that is understandable. Computers understand [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), so why are we using Rust? For that nice abstraction layer. Since we have this abstraction layer, why not put it to good use and make it simple? Remember the KISS principle.

> Code is there for humans, not computers, to understand.

## Tests

Tests are of vital importance during refactoring.
