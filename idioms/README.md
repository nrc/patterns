# Idioms

[Idioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_idiom) are commonly used styles and patterns largely agreed upon by a community. They are guidelines. Writing idiomatic code allows other developers to understand what is happening because they are familiar with the form that it has.

The computer understands the machine code that is generated by the compiler. The language is therefore mostly beneficial to the developer. Since we have this abstraction layer, why not put it to good use and make it simple? Remember the KISS principle.

> Code is there for humans, not computers, to understand.
