# Introduction

## Design patterns
When developing programs, we have to solve many problems. A program can be viewed as a solution to a problem. It can also be viewed as a collection of solutions to many different problems. All of these solutions work together to solve a bigger problem.

## Design patterns in Rust

There are many problems that share the same form. Due to the fact that Rust is not object-oriented design patterns vary with respect to other object-oriented programming languages. While the details are different, since they have the same form they can be solved using the same fundamental methods. 

[Design patterns](patterns/README.md) are methods to solve common problems when writing software.

[Anti-patterns](anti_patterns/README.md) are methods to solve these same common problems. 

However, while design patterns give us benefits, anti-patterns create more problems. There are some problems that we don't need to solve because [Rust rocks](rust_rocks.md)! 

[Idioms](idioms/README.md) are guidelines to follow when coding. They are social norms of the community. 
You can break them, but if you do you should have a good reason for it. 

[Refactoring](refactoring/README.md) is the process by which you convert code that works, but is hard to understand, into code that works and is easy to understand.

TODO: Mention why Rust is a bit special - functional elements, type system, borrow checker
