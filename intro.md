# Introduction

When developing programs, we have to solve many problems. A program can be viewed as a solution to a problem. It can also be viewed as a collection of solutions to many different problems. All of these solutions work together to solve a bigger problem.

There are many problems that share the same form. While the details are different, since they have the same form they can be solved using the same methods. [Design patterns](patterns/about.md) are methods to solve common problems when writing software. [Anti-patterns](anti_patterns/about.md) are methods to solve these same common problems. However, while design patterns give us benefits, anti-patterns create more problems. [Idioms](idioms/about.md) are guidelines to follow when coding. They are social norms of the community. You can break them, but if you do you should have a good reason for it. [Refactoring](refactoring/about.md) is the process by which you convert code that works, but is hard to understand, into code that works and is easy to understand.
