# Anti-patterns

[Anti-patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) are solutions to a "recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive". Just as valuable as the knowledge of how to do a thing is how not to do it. Anti-patterns give us great counter-examples to consider relative to design patterns. Anti-patterns are not confined to code. A process can be an anti-pattern.
