# `#![deny(warnings)]`

## Description

A well-intentioned crate author wants to ensure their code builds without
warnings. So they annotate their crate root with

## Example

```rust
#![deny(warnings)]

// All is well.
```

## Advantages

It is short and will stop the build if anything is amiss.

## Drawbacks

By disallowing the compiler to build with warnings, a crate author opts out of
Rust's famed stability. Sometimes new features or old misfeatures need a change
in how things are done, thus lints are written that `warn` for a certain grace
period before being turned to `deny`. Sometimes APIs get deprecated, so their
use will emit a warning where before there was none.

ALl this conspires to potentially break the build whenever something changes â€“
not only for the original developer, but also for those who wish to use their
code.

Furthermore, crates that supply additional lints (e.g. [rust-clippy]) can no
longer be used unless the annotation is removed.

## Alternatives

luckily, there are two ways of tackling this problem: First, we can decouple
the build setting from the code, and second, we can name the lints we want to
deny explicitly.

The following command line will build with all warnings set to `deny`:
 
```RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo build"```

This can be done by any individual developer (or be set in a CI tool like
travis, but remember that this may break the build when something changes)
without requiring a change to the code.

Alternatively, we can specify the lints that we want to `deny` in the code.
Here is a list of warning lints that is (hopefully) safe to deny:

```rust
#[deny(bad-style,
       const-err,
       dead-code,
       extra-requirement-in-impl,
       improper-ctypes,
       legacy-directory-ownership,
       non-shorthand-field-patterns,
       no-mangle-generic-items,
       overflowing-literals,
       path-statements ,
       patterns-in-fns-without-body,
       plugin-as-library,
       private-in-public,
       private-no-mangle-fns,
       private-no-mangle-statics,
       raw-pointer-derive,
       safe-extern-statics,
       unconditional-recursion,
       unions-with-drop-fields,
       unused,
       unused-allocation,
       unused-comparisons,
       unused-parens,
       while-true)]
```

In addition, the following `allow`ed lints may be a good idea to `deny`:

```rust
#[deny(missing-docs,
       trivial-casts,
       trivial-numeric-casts,
       unused-extern-crates,
       unused-import-braces,
       unused-qualifications,
       unused-results)]
```

Note that we explicitly did not set `deprecated`.
